### the feelings log

Diclaimer: This project came about with the help of a lot of classmates who helped me debug my code. Thank you to you all!

### The Idea 

The idea behind this project was to record feelings and reactions of people who are currently living the life in fear due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. In this space and time and in uncharted territories, its comforting to know that people are going through the same things. So i created this platform for people to share their thoughts, reactions and feelings and help calm themselves and go through the reactions of other people to know that they are not alone.
